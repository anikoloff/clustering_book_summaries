# Book Categorization Using K-Means

In this project, I analyze book summaries and cluster them into groups using k-Means.

This script can be used to solve text classification or topic tagging problems. Data preparation can be modified based on input data.

Data: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dbamman/booksummaries.html

Topics:
- Data Review and Preprocessing (vectorization using TF-IDF, stopwords removal)
- Modeling (MiniBatchKMeans, elbow method, K-Means clustering)
